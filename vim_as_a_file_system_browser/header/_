With every file creation the header should be added to that file, which
corresponds to the file name with _ 's replaced by spaces, and starts with a
capital letter, following one #. 

It should specify the full path, where slashes are replaced by > signs.

The next line after it is an empty line.

The header should be clickable. If you place cursor somewhere on the header, and
type gf it goes to that note.
