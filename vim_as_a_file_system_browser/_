The idea: vim should be able to browse all of the file system.

- [ ] When typing ef on some word it goes to that file or folder. If it's a
      folder it opens _ there, if it's a file it opens that file.
- [ ] *header*
- [ ] the path should be added at the top of each window (requires patching)
- [ ] find some beautiful replacement for asterisks for denoting the files. It
      could be vertical pipes
- [ ] reassign the control keys to something more intuitive and more accessible,
      including quit key
- [ ] make every note be read as an .md file
- [ ] when searching for a keyword exclude the dot files
- [ ] when searching for a keyword and clicking ESC it cancels without going
      anywhere
- [ ] when searching for a keyword and the menu pops up it cancels and doesn't
      go anywhere after clicking ESC
- [ ] make a command for going forward in history
- [ ] make it open the context of cword file inside the current note, just below
      the cursor

Notion: 
- [x] while editing notes it saves repeatedly. 
- [x] After each session it saves the path to the note where have you been
      last time, so that it opens it again in the next session. 
- [x] Also make it be able to rename the notes, e.g. folder names by changing
      the word inside the note. It can be done by typing something like ciw, but
      its alternative, then, you type the new word, and after pressing Esc it
      reads the word and renames the folder to it.
- [x] Also, make a function for searching for patterns throughout the note
      system, it can be done with the help of ack or grep -R.
- [ ] And make the notes be able to open the child note inside the current note.
- [x] Make the possibility to insert links inside the notes
- [x] Make the possibility to move some notes inside others
- [x] add "home", and "go back by history" keys
- [ ] if some folder doesn't have any text in _ delete it automatically when
      moving somewhere else
- [x] restore textwidth
- [ ] make Rename() function remove the current directory after
      popup_filter_yes_no if it currently exists before inserting new one
- [ ] make a schedule folder where it moves some tasks to the *../../today* folder
      if the proper time came, or the reminders field, perhaps at the top of the
      home page.
- [ ] make *dynamic_tables*
- [x] make a link function that works with `ln` command
- [ ] implement logging system
- [ ] write tests
- [x] make it write motion history specifying paths starting with the notion
      root

File browser: 
- [ ] while edititng files it should be saved explicitly, but when not
      saved then go back forcefully or not. There should be two commands for
      both.
- [ ] And when opening some directory there should be notes at the top, followed
      by a line of -'s, then a couple of lines containing single dots, then the
      same line with -'s, and the list of files in the directory. The list of
      files with the header isn't contained in the _ file, instead it's placed
      there temporarily, which is cleared with each :w command, and written with
      each directory opening.
- [ ] If the line after the header is edited then don't clear that particular
      line.  To determine whether it's edited or not the amount of words in the
      line could be compared. If it's 1 then the line is not edited, if more
      then it is and should be written to the file. Just move it right before
      the header before saving.
- [ ] When opening a directory it should open a file called _ that is a
      directory description, it contains short notes and the directory
      description.
